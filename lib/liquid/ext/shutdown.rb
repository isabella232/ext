module Shutdown

  # Receives a time span in seconds and a block which will be registered for execution when the program exits.
  # If multiple hanlders are registered, they are executed in reverse order of registration.
  #
  # If a handler throws an exception or takes longer then the specified time span, execution skips to the next
  # handler in line.
  #
  # If the first parameter is nil, the handler will not check the codes runtime. Be cautios when executing
  # asynchronous code when the 'seconds' parameter set to nil value as blocking codes would prevent
  # the process from terminating.
